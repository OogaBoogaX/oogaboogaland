// The chain snapshot: one bounded view of the Bitcoin mempool, blocks and mining, assembled from
// whichever source answers. The mempool.space websocket in mempool.js is the live transport for the
// backlog, fee tiers, difficulty, inflow and blocks; this module polls REST for what the socket never
// sends (the fee histogram behind the ladder and the rain, block pace, hashrate) and for everything
// while the socket is down, and holds its own Coinbase socket for the price, with REST behind it.
//
// Two providers, one code path. `/mempool`, `/mempool/recent`, `/blocks` and `/blocks/tip/height`
// return the same shapes from mempool.space and from any Esplora instance, so the fallback is a base
// URL swap; the mempool.space-only endpoints are dropped for ten minutes when they fail and tried
// again after, leaving `/fee-estimates` (same shape on both) to stand in for the fee tiers. Every reader
// tolerates a missing field rather than branching.
//
// Polite by construction: one poll of a kind at a time, each cycle rescheduling from its own
// completion, every failure widening the gap, and Retry-After obeyed when a provider sends one.
//
// Nothing here allocates per frame: the snapshot is one object mutated in place and the fee ladder is
// a fixed typed array. Weather reads the two derived axes at the foot of the snapshot.
//
// The snapshot is the standing view behind the weather and the Mempool cave: backlog, the fee ladder
// in fixed rungs, tip, block pace, difficulty epoch, hashrate and price. The socket's `stats` and
// `fees` land in it (coalesced into one announce a tick later) and stamp `socketAt`, never
// `succeeded`, so a REST provider's backoff and Retry-After stand; while they are fresh, REST
// `/mempool` adds only the histogram and the fee and difficulty endpoints are skipped. REST polls
// only while the tab is visible, and a 200 whose body has no usable shape counts as a failure, not a
// poll. Three consecutive failures swap the base URL to Esplora; the preferred provider is probed
// every fifteen minutes.
//
// `derive` sets the weather axes. `soak` comes from the paying backlog: `paying` is the vsize at
// 1 sat/vB or more (the fee ladder's first rung before normalizing), `payEma` its ten-minute average
// by elapsed time, cached for reloads, and `paySoak` maps it on a log scale from PAY_DRY to PAY_FULL
// MvB. `gale` comes from the socket's inflow and is zero once the socket is stale.
//
// The live price is Coinbase Exchange's public `ticker_batch` socket (`readTicker`: `type:
// "ticker"`, strings parsed, `open_24h` as `priceOpenUsd`), subscribed in `onopen` because the feed
// drops a socket not subscribed within five seconds; an `error` or an empty `subscriptions` closes it
// with backoff, and PRICE_STALL of silence (the feed says nothing while the price is flat) redials.
// Only while it is not delivering does the minute REST walk run through PRICE_SOURCES in order of
// measured speed (Coinbase Exchange stats, Kraken, Coinbase spot, mempool.space), so a degraded chain
// source keeps its ticker; the first two carry the day's open (Coinbase's a rolling 24 hours,
// Kraken's today's UTC), and the walk goes on past a found price until the open is known.
//
// `snapshot.live` (a fresh socket push or REST poll) is computed on read, never stored, and the last
// snapshot rides in sessionStorage to paint a reload before the first poll lands. Exports start,
// setHidden, subscribe, dispose, derive and snapshot among others; the director leaves it off under
// `nosim` and `chain=0`, and `chain=esplora` or `chain=https://host/api` pins the provider.
