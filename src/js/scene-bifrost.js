// ₿IFRÖST: the chamber of windows onto other worlds. A short tunnel from the island opens into a round hall of stone
// and bronze; the ₿ mechanism turns at its middle, and round the wall stand the windows, an open world's labelled
// over its arch. Travel is walking: an Ooga that walks through a window's field goes to that world (into the poker room
// at once, as its mirror back does), and one that walks into a window whose world is not open yet crosses its
// reflection and emerges from the next mirror. A window's frame glows brighter as someone comes near, in its world's
// colour, and the mechanism charges toward that colour too. Nobody but an Ooga crosses, so a visit without one only looks.
//
// Whoever walked in stays themselves: the Ooga the island handed over (`world.pilot`), or on a page that opens here,
// `character=`. From the island it comes in through the tunnel's field, from a world out of that world's window; on a
// page that opens here it stands at the tunnel's inner end. Walking back out through the field, Escape and the Leave
// button all take it back out to the island's gate.
//
// An open world's window shows that world itself: its models are built off the graph and photographed once a page (the
// poker room once for each cave theme it shows), in its own light, while the screen is dark, and the picture hangs at
// the end of the window's passage. Until then the window shows its row's stand-in.
