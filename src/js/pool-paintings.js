// The chamber's wall paintings: the chain read out in pigment on the earth of the room under the lake. Four
// reading stops, one on each flat face the layout cuts into the round wall (`poolLayout.STOPS`): what is waiting,
// what it costs, the newest block, and the difficulty epoch.
//
// Every figure is set in the jumbotron's 5x7 font and merged into quads by `poolModels.panelFrom`, with no backing:
// only the painted pixels become geometry, so the wall shows between the letters. Each row is a label, the reading
// itself at twice the size and its unit, sized to be read from the floor at an Ooga's eye height without opening
// anything; the handprints, figures, bands and tallies beside them are bounded groups that repeat the reading and
// never stand in for it. Ochre, red earth, charcoal and bone; a stop shimmers when its reading changes and settles
// back to matte.
//
// Every reading is bound to its own field of the one `chain.snapshot`, with the freshness of its own category: the
// backlog, the fees, the block and the price each carry a stamp (`backlogAt`, `feesAt`, `heightAt`, `priceAt`), zero
// until this session has observed them. A category seen this session and still fresh is LIVE under its source's
// name; one grown old is STALE with its age and goes grey; a figure restored from the last visit is HELD; one never
// seen is NO READING and a dash, never a zero. An observed zero stays a zero. The epoch's figures carry no stamp of
// their own, so their age is said to be unknown. A new block's weight is held back until the reading that
// belongs to that block arrives, so a height never stands over the last block's details.
//
// A stop's panel is rebuilt only when what it prints changes, and the geometry it replaces is released. Each stop
// also keeps a `board` for the shared board dialog: the same painting on dark stone, with its definitions.
