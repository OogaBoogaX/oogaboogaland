// Ooga Arcade's carnival games as games of their own: skee-ball (`skee`), hoop shot (`hoops`), the coconut shy
// (`shy`) and the claw machine (`claw`), each a scene reached from its machine in the arcade and leaving back to it. They share one presentation:
// the arcade hall around the machine, a camera that dollies in from wide to the player's eye through a 3-2-1
// countdown and shakes on the big moments, a mobile-first HUD (score and best, what is left and the round, the
// power meter with its green window, big callouts, one thumb-sized action button), a pause card on Escape, and a
// results card with stars, the best, and the tickets won for the prize counter.
//
// The rules live in `arcade-games.js`; this module stages them, reads their `status` for the HUD (written only
// when a value changes) and records bests and tickets at the end. The mezzanine's eight retro cabinets are staged
// the same way (`retro-games.js`): the machine is the cabinet, the game's own screen is drawn over its glass, and it
// sounds through the cabinet's chip, its cues by `CHIP_CUES` and its tune from Go until the game decides the run,
// halted on pause.
//
// The HUD around every game is the same: the score rolls up to each new value with a pop (down, with a shake, on a
// penalty); under it a goal bar fills toward the game's three star thresholds (`stars`) and lights each star as the
// score passes it; passing the best the run started with is its own moment (a NEW BEST ribbon, the tusk horn, the
// watchers cheering, and the Best box following the score); a streak of two or more shows as "N in a row", with the
// multiplier when a game sets an optional `status.mult`; the first run of each game in a page visit shows one
// coaching line under the meter; and the results tally the score up, lighting each star as it passes, with the
// optional `status.note` (a breakdown the game writes) under the total. A big moment (`crack` with `big`) is a
// hit-stop: the juice slows to near still and eases back over SLOW seconds, and the game with it only while its verb is
// empty, so a timing window the player is reading never slows. Act answers on the press itself (the key, the pointer
// going down on the canvas or the button). In a game whose press is an action rather than a stop on something
// moving (one steered by `aims`, or one that sets `buffers`), a press refused while the game still shows its action
// (a cooldown) is held for BUFFER seconds and taken the moment the game will, unless the action, the count or the
// round moves on first; everywhere else a press is timed against a sweep or a meter, so it is taken or dropped on its
// own frame, as holding it would move it off the moment the player chose and let a mashed key land on a sweep's first
// frame. A game takes a press when it plays a cue or changes its verb, which is how every act here answers.
//
// The juice is the Oogas' own and changes nothing a game scores: a hand drum rolls under the countdown; on a big
// moment a coconut cracks (two husk halves fly apart across the view and spill coconut milk), the camera punches in,
// and the watchers chant OOGA!; an ordinary score throws a puff of husk chips. Two or three Oogas from the roster
// watch at the edges of each game's view, leaning in while you aim, cheering, clutching their heads at a flop and
// dancing at three stars, and the results card says what they think.
