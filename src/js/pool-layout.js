// The Mempool island's one layout: every dimension of the rainforest, its lake, its tunnels and the chamber under
// the lake, and the voxel body cut from them. The models, the water, the weather, the hub's scatter, the animals
// and the clankers' beds all read this file, so the ground a visitor sees, stands on, swims over and sleeps on
// is one authority and cannot disagree with itself.
//
// Metres, in the island's own frame: y = 0 is the bridge's top datum, +z points back at the home island and a
// bearing runs from +z toward +x (x = r sin, z = r cos). The top is nominally 44 across, the home island's inner
// meadow. A lake 16 across opens down through a hole in the ground onto a transparent membrane (`membraneY`),
// and under it stands a chamber 24 across at FLOOR, round an open shaft 8 across that runs out through the
// island's underside. One descent (`RAMP`) winds 100 m round the chamber at a 10% grade from a hillside mouth
// beside the bridge court down to the chamber, under a ridge that keeps a roof on it; an outside ledge runs down
// the cliff beside it to two doors through the rock (`DOORS`), and a window overlooks the chamber on the way.
//
// The ground is terraces half a metre apart, as the home island's hills are: the court and the shore at 0, a
// lowland ring at 0.5, the forest floor and the ring path at 1, the nests at 1.5 and the ridge up to 4.5.
// Channels (`CHANNELS`) run from the shore to the cliff between the nests with their beds at -0.5, so water
// standing at any level floods exactly the terraces below it: the lake to the spill crest at 0, then the shore
// and the channels, then the lowland, while the path and every nest stay dry above the highest flood.
//
// `body()` fills the grid once for the page and keeps it: `groundAt`, `solidAt` and `covered` read it back.
