// The Mempool island's weather, derived from the chain snapshot rather than pinged by it. One reading drives the
// storm: how fast transactions are arriving, in virtual bytes a second (chain.js `inflow`, normalised as `gale`).
// Smoothed, it names one of six standing steps (dry, drizzle, light rain, rain, heavy rain, downpour) and sets how
// thick and dark the cloud deck stands; as it arrives it sets the wind. What is waiting is the lake's business
// (pool-water.js), not the sky's: a full lake under a clearing sky is the mempool draining. A block strikes.
//
// Arrivals are raw from the socket, so the storm follows them through an average of STORM_TAU seconds and the
// steps' own hysteresis: clouds gather, darken, rain and disperse without flickering. A reading is only as good as
// the socket that sent it: once `socketAt` is older than ARRIVALS_FRESH_MS the storm eases to calm and reports the
// reading unavailable, measured here every frame, never as nothing arriving.
//
// One fixed-capacity instanced batch carries the rain. Bolts are eight jagged variants built once at
// boot and picked at random, so a strike allocates nothing. The sky is written over the daylight clock's colours after it
// samples; the clock, its sun, moon, phases and factors are never touched, and a clear sky leaves
// every sampled value exactly as it was.
//
// The weather is a cell standing over one place, not a curtain that follows the camera. `create`
// takes the cell's `centre` and the `heightAt` its rain lands on (-Infinity where there is nothing under a
// drop); precipitation falls inside FIELD_R of that centre, sky, fog and flash scale by `near` (full within
// NEAR_FULL, gone by NEAR_NONE) and the sound by its own shorter HEARD_FULL/HEARD_NONE, so the rain is heard only
// around the rainforest. `update` takes a `shelter` (0 to 1): under the island's ground the sky, the flash and
// the sound of the storm stay outside, and only a distant thunder comes through.
//
// `stepFor(storm, prev)` climbs a step as soon as the storm reaches it and leaves it only HYSTERESIS below.
// How much falls, the drop size and the sky's grey follow the continuous `wetAt(storm)` through the
// steps' own points, so a step names the weather while the rain only eases.
// Lightning is for new blocks only: every block strikes whatever the weather is doing, nothing else does; a bolt
// takes a random turn, scale and mirror. The rain batch is tier-scaled, and drops fall straight down inside
// the cell; wind only carries the clouds and their sound. The sky goes through `cloudFor` on
// `wetAt`, the same clear band, after `daylight.sample`. Audio is background: MASTER sits under the rally and drop
// engines and a strike is a few times the rain, never the page's loudest thing.
//
// Exports STEPS, stepFor, wetAt, cloudFor and create; an instance offers apply, strike, update,
// setMuted, dispose, state, active and stats.
