// The Lightning Factory: a Lightning node at work, shown as a factory in a tiered cavern behind the 2 o'clock
// mouth, run by gorillas in hard hats. Everything that moves is driven by the node's event stream through
// `factory-feed.js`; until a real node publishes, `factory-mock.js` plays a demo node, and the entrance says so.
//
// What each station shows, and what it may not (Foundry's consumer rules, docs/lightning-factory.md):
// - The node core glows while the node runs and goes dark when it says it stopped.
// - Four featured lines stand on the main and high levels, each with two capacitors: blue lights on a settled
//   forward, orange sputters on a failed one. A forward's sats ride inside the glass conduits: in along the line it
//   came in on, through the core, and out along the line it left by, when the event names that line (the demo
//   contract's `out`; Foundry's public events name one line only, and then the sats only go in). A failed forward's
//   sats reach the core and come back, glowing red, and the line they were bound for sputters. A large forward is a
//   stream of sats and a surge through the node: the chamber flares white, rings of light climb it and the Tesla
//   coils arc to it.
// - The on-chain forge fires when a line is opened or closed; its bay's lantern turns red while it is taken down. An
//   opening sends carts of sats up the left shaft from the chain for the forge to consume; a close has it mint a coin
//   that rolls back down the right shaft. The carts count the opening's bucketed size, never an amount.
// - The switchboard's screens light with every forward; its board carries the node's own counts and
//   Foundry's hourly summary, which is labelled as Foundry's.
// - The rebalancer spins for a rebalance, and never touches a line.
// - The treasury's gold is the node's public capacity; its belt carries each of the demo node's fees to the crate.
// - The banana cooker takes the tips, which are not the node's events and never ride a line: the core flashes green
//   and throws a tip's lime sats across the hall (in through the way out while the node is stopped), the jaw swallows
//   them, the cooker chews, and the bananas slide down its chute and fly out through the gate to the island, where the
//   level already counts them. Its board counts tips and bananas for the page, labelled simulated, and never names a
//   donor or a time. The rebalancer, the treasury and the cooker stand in a row on one platform along the right wall.
// - The donation kiosk built into the right wall at the walkway's end runs the whole simulated donation on its screen
//   (`factory-kiosk.js`): an amount, its quote in bananas, an invoice with its QR and expiry, the wait and the payment,
//   which sends the view round to watch the cooker take that very tip. A tip from the island's dialog turns the view to
//   the show too.
// - The watchtower's beam sweeps while the feed is live and goes dark when it falls silent: that is "no
//   signal", which is not the same as the node stopping.
// - The galleries under the vault hold the lines past the featured four; the study hall is locked for now.
//
// The first view stands on the entrance balcony and looks across at the core, the way the concept frames it.
// Escape, the Leave button and the tunnel behind the balcony all go back to the island.
