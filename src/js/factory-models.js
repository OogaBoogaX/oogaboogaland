// The Lightning Factory's geometry: a tiered cavern behind the 2 o'clock mouth, the tunnel the hub dresses that
// mouth with, and the light stand-in of the hall the hub's window shows through its shield (`hubWindow`). Everything
// is cached and built once per page; the scene places nodes and animates them.
//
// `LAYOUT` is the one table of where everything stands, read by the scene as well, so the camera presets, the
// point lights, the gorillas' decks and the geometry cannot disagree. The cave's frame: the node core stands
// over the origin, +z runs out toward the entrance balcony and -z into the back wall, and the tiers step up
// from the pit (y 0) to the galleries under the vault. Levels are LEVEL.pit, low, main, high and top.
//
// Station pieces are built facing +z, the way a visitor on the balcony reads them, and turned into place by the
// scene. Where the scene animates a part (the core's chamber, a capacitor's glass, the rebalancer's ring, the
// lookout's beam, the treasury's pile and hopper, the carts, the cooker's jaw, porthole and gears) it is its own
// geometry, with a lit and a dim
// variant where it flashes, so a flash is a geometry swap and never a rebuild.
//
// The house style: timber and stone are chamfered `bevelBox`es; the machines are turned, lathes and tubes shaded
// smooth, with their signs (the bolt, the Bitcoin sign) cut as smooth solids. Labels are lit boards set in the
// system's sans (`label`), as the concept letters them.
