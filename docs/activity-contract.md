# Contributor activity

Character status uses real contribution times: **working** ("clanking") for less
than one hour, **chilling** from one to 24 hours, then **sleeping**. Activity in any tracked
OogaBoogaX repository can make an Ooga work; each project keeps its own timestamp so
work routes can choose the corresponding cave. The existing static roster remains a
historical fallback and does not pretend that its old commits just happened.
With `?debug=1`, an explicit fixture instead starts three Oogas working, three
chilling, and three sleeping so the routines can be previewed without a live feed.
`seedDebugActivity()` is called only on that debug path.

Roster activity labels use yellow **clankin**, orange **chillin**, and gray **sleepin**.
A separate dot before the name is green when `cave.humanControlled` is true and gray
when offline. The tooltip dot keeps its existing behavior: green for human presence,
otherwise the activity color. Local possession and release update the flag and both
roster readouts immediately, including while sleeping.
A future global presence adapter can update the same flag and call
`crew.refreshRosterRow(cave)`; tooltip status follows it each frame. Presence does
not replace the character's activity state or contribution timestamps.

The Oogatron integration exports `BL.jumbotronData`, an Oogatron schema 3
snapshot (baked from `/v2/stats`), and the live poller pushes the same shape
through `applySnapshot` once a minute, so a sleeper whose contribution lands
wakes and walks out within minutes. A schema-3 snapshot's `repos[].contributors`
rows fan out onto per-repository keys — that is what routes each working Ooga
to the cave of the repo they actually contributed to (a fresh repo with no
cave falls back to the Ooga Booga Land cave). The adapter accepts org-wide
schema 2/3 snapshots, legacy schema 1 project snapshots, or an array of
either:

```js
BL.contributors.applySnapshot({
  meta: { schema_version: 3, org: "OogaBoogaX", generated_at: "2026-09-21T00:00:00Z" },
  contributors: [
    { login: "public-handle", last_seen_at: "2026-09-17T12:34:56Z" }
  ]
});
```

Oogatron returns `last_seen_at`: the latest event time for a contributor's commits,
pull requests, reviews, merges, and comments. `scripts/jumbotron-data.mjs`
preserves that field alongside `login`:

```js
last_seen_at: c.last_seen_at,
```

Weekly counts and the snapshot's `generated_at` cannot establish whether someone
contributed within the past four hours, so the adapter ignores rows without a valid
activity timestamp. Profile names, email addresses, and avatars are not imported.

The activity adapter is event-type agnostic, so a merge timestamp will use the same
four-hour and 48-hour windows when Oogatron includes merges in `last_seen_at`.
Oogatron currently stores `mergedAt` in a pull request event's payload but timestamps
that event with the pull request's creation time; an older pull request merged today
therefore still needs an Oogatron-side event/timestamp update to count as activity today.

Repository names normalize to lowercase. Any `OogaBoogaX/<repo>` is accepted, with
`w-s-bitcoin/entropylab` as the historical alias. GitHub handles match without case;
the existing public alias `ottoz0r` maps to the `bc1gui` character. Unknown handles
do not create new characters. Each character stores at most 64 repositories.
Malformed, future, repeated, and older timestamps do not replace newer activity.

`BL.contributors.hasRecentActivity(contributor, "oogaboogax/entropylab")` is the
allocation-free work-route query; pass the canonical lowercase repository key.
`stateFor(contributor)` and `ageLabel(contributor)` use the newest timestamp across
projects. The roster orders characters from newest to oldest activity and displays
minute-level ages for the first hour. `subscribe(callback)` reports accepted activity
batches and returns an unsubscribe function. These updates supplement the existing
minute status refresh, which advances every visible age and lets working status expire
without receiving a new event.

The lower-level adapter accepts millisecond timestamps when an upstream provider
has already normalized its data:

```js
BL.contributors.applyActivity([
  { name: "public-handle", repo: "OogaBoogaX/entropylab", lastCommitAt: 1789648496000 }
]);
```

`lastCommitAt` is retained for compatibility and represents the latest supported
contribution, including non-commit events. An omitted `repo` defaults to EntropyLab.

The page remains network-free. Oogatron's worker syncs every ten minutes, and the
Pages workflow fetches `/v1/stats`, rebuilds the bundled page, and deploys it on the
same cadence. A visitor receives the newest deployed snapshot; the UI never
manufactures recent contribution activity when a row has no valid timestamp.
